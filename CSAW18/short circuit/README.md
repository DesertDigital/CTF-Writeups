#Short Circuit
```
Start from the monkey's paw and work your way down the high voltage line, for every wire that is branches off has an element that is either on or off. Ignore the first bit. Standard flag format.
```

The challenge gives us an image of a very poorly written circuit diagram. By tracing through the LED's we can determine if the LED is on (1) or off (0). This gives us a binary number that we can convert into ASCII and obtain the flag.
