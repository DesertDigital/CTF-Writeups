Issue with first exploit is that because the exploit script is in the home directory it is
looking for the flag file in the home directory instead of the directory located in the challenge
folder. To fix issue
```  ln -s /problems/overflow-1_0_48b13c56d349b367a4d45d7d1aa31780/flag.txt ~/flag.txt ```
